# cli_met_museum

The full idea of this Cli is to allow the user to experience the museum by department and specific category.  The departments will be listed but the next endpoints will be chosen at random.  

Refactor to save call details into arrays so that multiple calls wouldnt happen.  Successful completed methods to of belong-to relationship.  Did not quite utilize it the way intended but the success lies in the methods used to save the first call method.  Next the attempt will be to successfully stop the third call from being use on the same information twice.
