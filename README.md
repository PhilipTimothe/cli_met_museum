# Cli Met Museum Project

## Concept & Inspiration

This project was inspired by the idea of exploring art.  Museum art is extraordinary and the chance to experience it is worth a moment or two.  This project does just that.  Its purpose is to give the user the opportunity to explore art through a series of commands.  These commands will allow the user to make leveled choices that will ultimately lead to details/data on a specific gnere of art but at random selection.
